## Business Structure???? Think of better title

### Site Goals

The general goal of the site is to allow users to easily purchase jewellery products. It is focussed towards providing more unusual artistic jewellery and promoting the designers that make the products.

#### Site Owners Goals:
* To easily sell their jewellery products online.
* To promote their most interesting products.
* To highlight their focus on jewellery design by promoting their designers.

#### External Users Goals:
* To browse for interesting artistic jewellery products.
* To easily purchase jewellery products online.

### Business Model

Jewellery Art is based around a traditional B2C (Business to Customer) model and sells jewellery products to the customer using a single payment system. The products are sourced from various jewellery designers partnered with the site. The focus of the site on jewellery design and designers means that there is also the potential to expand into providing services such as jewellery making classes or perhaps bespoke jewellery design services. These would still likely be single payment purchase rather than subscription services.

### Web Marketing

There is quite a lot of competition in the jewellery market with a high volume of sites focusing on more traditional jewellery, often made of gold or including precious stones. Jewellery Art focuses on the more unusual artistic pieces often found in art gallery shops. There is less competition in this area but it is also more of a niche market with a smaller customer base. Marketing and particularly web marketing would therefore be essential to increase traffic to the site.

Social media marketing is likely to be key in attracting people and building a customer base. An organic approach is likely to be the best starting point when building up interest as the marketing budget would likely be low at the beginning. Potential customers are likely to be artistic themselves or interested in art. This type of person is often active on Instagram and so marketing on this platform would be a must. The image focussed site is likely the suit the business due to the striking products being sold. Most of the designers featured on the site are also likely to be active on social media and so a collaborative social medial marketing approach would be possible increasing the audience. Competitors in this area such as Tatty Devine or Wolf and Moon also target, Facebook and Twitter and these sites should also be utilised. With marketing in mind a Facebook business page has been created and linked to in the site footer. It can be viewed [here](https://www.facebook.com/Jewellery-Art-104568275512777/). If the site is no longer available an image can be found [here](docs/screenshots/facebook-page.jpg).

Email marketing will also be a useful way to market the site and turn interested parties into paying customers by providing deals and updates on the latest products. A Mailchimp newsletter signup box has been provided at the bottom of the homepage enticing the users with the posibility of offers.
